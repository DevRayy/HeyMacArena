Run MTG Arena on Mac with custom resolution without Epic Games Launcher

## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. ``chmod +x run_arena.sh``
3. Run ``run_arena.sh`` providing fullscreen mode and resolution, for example ``./run_arena.sh 0 1650 1050``

If you want to run MTGA from Spotlight just create .command file just like im the example. 
1. Clone repository
2. Edit exemplary ``.command`` file to run your ``run_arena.sh`` script.
3. ``chmod +x your_file.command``

Of course you can have multiple ``.command`` with various resolution settings if you need to.
